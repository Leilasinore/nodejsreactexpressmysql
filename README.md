# nodejsreactexpressmysql--application that can let you fetch ,delete,post and update books data that is in a mysql database

install mysql2,express,cors, and start a react application on another folder

set up express server

create a database management system on mysql workbench

backend code queries the database for different end points of requests eg POST,PUT,GET sent to the server

the frontend code which is React code makes the requests to the server,,this could have otherwise be achieved with POSTMAN but the goal of the application was to use a React client.
